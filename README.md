# Animal Simulation Agent-Based Model

This is a simulation of an agent-based model featuring three animals: tiger, leopard, and wild boar.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you will need Julia version 1.8.5 installed on your system.

1. Install Julia by following the instructions provided on the official Julia website: [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

2. After installing Julia, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have downloaded or cloned this repository.

3. Run the `package_installer.jl` file to install the required packages. Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```shell
   julia package_installer.jl
```
## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the main.jl file. Use the following command:

```shell
   julia main.jl
```

## Modifying Parameters

You can modify the parameters of the simulation by editing the model/model.jl file. 

Adjust the initialization parameters and the distribution map according to your requirements in the main.jl file.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different parameter values to observe the effects on the animal simulation.
